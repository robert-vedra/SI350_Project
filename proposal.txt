Project will accomplish:

We are creating a comprehensive web of pages for all Naval Academy club sports. This will include each club sport having their own welcome page and relevant information. It will also include a master competition schedule for the teams and login for each team to see more specific information (practices/meetings). Bobby will work on the welcome pages/CSS, search functionality, Reese will work on the login functionalities/sign ups, Tommy will work on the server/client scripting, authentication, and outside topic. Before the milestone we will have an outline for the structure of the pages/how they will interact with each other. Some of the specific pages will have competition information based on what we can gather from on the internet. There will be some login function to access more specific team information.
